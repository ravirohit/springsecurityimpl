================================ NOTE ===================
AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer:This class implements Spring's WebApplicationInitializer. That means the concrete implementations of this 
                   abstract class will be initialized by SpringServletContainerInitializer given that the spring-web module is on classpath. 
				-> AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer registers the DelegatingFilterProxy to use the springSecurityFilterChain before 
				   any other registered Filter.
                -> The onStartup() method of this class, creates an instance of AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext which registers client side 
                    @Configuration classes with it and bootstraps Spring container.
                -> code example: 
                   public class AppSecurityInitializer extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer {
					  public AppSecurityInitializer() {
					      super(MyAppConfig.class);
					  }
					}
			   -> Note that, it's not necessary to call super(MyAppConfig.class) from the constructor, if our configuration class is already registered 
			      via DispatcherServlet (if it's Spring MVC application)
-> DelegatingFilterProxy:The DelegatingFilterProxy is a servlet filter that allows passing control to Filter classes that have access to the Spring 
                  application context. 
-> @EnableWebSecurity: This annotation is used on our configuration class to important necessary Spring security configuration. 
               -> Example: 
                    @Import({ WebSecurityConfiguration.class, SpringWebMvcImportSelector.class })
					@EnableGlobalAuthentication
					@Configuration
					public @interface EnableWebSecurity {
					 ....
					}
-> WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter: it is implemented by the client application (usually by @Configuration class) to customize WebSecurity and HttpSecurity.
-> WebMvcConfigurerAdapter: This is an abstract class that implements the WebMvcConfigurer interface and contains empty implementations for all the methods 
                inherited like resolvers, interceptors and more.
              -> Java 8 added the concept of default methods in interfaces. So,  the WebMvcConfigurer interface, starting with Spring 5, contains default 
                 implementations for all its methods. As a result, the abstract adapter class was marked as deprecated.
